# LT0, LT1, and M1W2 Insights

- Doing these tasks has helped me significantly understand the concepts of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. For LT0, I discovered and experienced GitHub, a game changer, especially for programmers. GitHubâ€™s complexity and technicality may not be suitable for everyone, but using it every day made me learn and adapt when using it. For LT1, developing a website in general is challenging as you need to plan and analyze the things you need for your website to be accessible and working. The learning task has helped me understand the concepts and general overview of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. As an aspiring web developer, I am eager to take on more challenges in web development as I want to improve and build more websites since every project gives a new learning opportunity. For the M1W2, the exercises were challenging, but at the same time, I learned a lot about CSS, especially as a novice. The exercises helped me understand and familiarize myself with the overview of CSS.

# LT0, LT1, and M1W2 Challenges

- The challenges I have encountered when doing these activities are manageable. Still, at the same time, you need to research and explore the internet to provide alternative solutions that may apply to the problems you encounter. For LT0, the challenges I faced were changing, as well as how I would do the README file as an introduction for my profile. Moreover, the GitHub commands were initially challenging as they confused me when I first used them. As time passes, I can now use the GitHub commands comfortably. However, I still need to explore other commands that may be useful when coding. For LT1, I faced several challenges in building my website, but the most challenging among them was the CSS. The CSS properties were easy to comprehend and use, especially when doing basic things for the website. However, the difficult part for me was changing the properties multiple times. Some elements were challenging to apply styling, especially when moving around the containers (div). My challenges inspired me to do better in web development by continuing to challenge myself to build projects to improve my skills and understanding since every project and challenge is an opportunity to learn more. Lastly, I had difficulty figuring out CSS for M1W2, the same as for the LT1, since it was my first time using and experiencing it.

# Learning Task 1 Experience (per criteria)

- Application of Concepts Taught

  - For the application of concepts taught criteria, in building a website, it is manageable and at the same time it is challenging, especially the use of flexbox and for the responsiveness. In solving and relieving the challenges I encountered, I browse the web about the certain solution that I need for every problem that I encountered.

- Design

  - For the design criteria, even though if we think of it that it is easy to implement and create a design. In my experience, I had a hard time for the design of my personal website. The recommended youtube video provided served as my reference for my personal website since I also want my personal website to have a minimal and not so sophisticated design since I am into simplicity and minimalist designs.I tweaked a few things from the tutorial and made customizations for my preference. I started first by sketching a low-fidelity of my personal website and list down the sections and content that I will be including.After with the low-fidelity, I now started creating a high-fidelity for my website using Figma. Using Figma gives freedom for everyone as it has resources you may need in designing.

- Content

  - For the content, since it is a personal website, I just followed the usual content of most personal websites I have seen, including the tutorial video's website. For my personal website, I added an education section and I tweaked the about section. Also, I visited personal websites as my reference for the possible contents that I may include.

- Creativity
  - For the creativity, since I relied from the tutorial video, I made some changes in manipulating and experimenting with the elements of both HTML and CSS, mainly the containers (div) and the properties in CSS. The about section gave me a challenge as I need to play with the code multiple times since I am having a hard time what to change in properties and elements, especially in CSS. Moreover, I added animations for the title and the picture to spice things up.
- Deployment
  - For deployment, I relied with the reference/source from GitHub. Although, I just watched a tutorial video about GitHub pages than reading the GitHub docs. As per my experience, after I pushed my first commit for my personal website, GitHub pages was automatically activated, so I was surprised that I did not need to configure GitHub pages on my repository's settings.

# How could I Improve my Website in the Future

- I could improve my website by watching more videos about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript since it is helpful as you gain more insights from developers/programmers. I would also challenge myself to do more projects since it will allow me to face new challenges and find solutions to my problems. I would also visit websites from Awwwards since looking at their websites inspires me even more to do better. Also, I would take workshops, conferences, or webinars to gain more knowledge and helpful tips from developers worldwide.
